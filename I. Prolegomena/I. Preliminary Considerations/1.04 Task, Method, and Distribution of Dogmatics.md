## The Task of Dogmatics

"One's conception of dogma and Dogmatics will naturally determine one's view of the task of Dogmatics" (Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 2019: 44).

"According to Friedrich Schleiermacher, it is the task of Dogmatics to describe the feelings the Church experiences in union with Jesus Christ, the Savior. For him, Religion is neither knowledge nor moral action but feeling, more specifically, a feeling of dependence on the ultimate reality, which arises only within the Christian community, and dogma is merely the intellectual expression or interpretation of the inner significance of this religious feeling" (Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 2019, 44).

"In Alan Ritschl circles, it is customary to speak of Dogmatics as the scientific exposition of the Christian faith or as the science of the Christian faith. This faith, however, is not always conceived in the same way" (Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 2019, 45).

"Ernest Troeltsch was motivated by a desire to secure a greater measure of objectivity for Dogmatics and therefore suggested a religious-historical norm of universal validity, rather than Ritschl, to establish the truth of the Christian religion. In his estimation, this should be sought not merely in the study of the history of the Christian religion, but in the study of religions in general" (Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 2019, 46).

"Paul Althaus Schaeder criticizes both the Ritschlian position and that of Troeltsch. The former postulates a God to secure certain moral interests, and the latter leaves Jesus to be much amid the relativism of history, instead of seeing in Him the unique revelation of God in history" (Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 2019, 47).

"Karl Barth respected the task of Dogmatics, which can be indicated briefly by quoting some of his own words. Says he, 'As a theological discipline, dogmatics is the scientific test to which the Christian Church puts herself regarding the language about God which is peculiar to her.' The task of Dogmatics is, therefore, to test the language of the Church respecting God, to make sure that it agrees with the divine revelation" (Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 2019, 48).

"The task of dogmatics is to outline valid truth in scientific form and embrace the entirety of Christian doctrine. It seeks to give a systematic presentation of all the doctrinal truths of the Christian religion. It may not rest satisfied with a description of what was at one time the content of the faith of the Church but must aim at absolute or ideal truth" (Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 2019, 49).

## The Method of Dogmatics

"The first question that comes into consideration is, therefore, the source and norm of Dogmatics. Historically, there are mainly three views that come into consideration, namely: (a) that Scripture is the source of Dogmatics; (b) that the teaching of the Church constitutes the actual source; and (c) that the Christian consciousness must be regarded as the source. "

The sole source of theology is [The Principium Cognoscendi Externum (Revelation)](onenote:https://d.docs.live.net/fc52dea27c35b98d/Documents/Reformed%20Dogmatics/Prolegomena/2%20The%20Doctrine%20of%20Scripture.one#2.02%20The%20Principium%20Cognoscendi%20Externum%20\(Revelation\)&section-id={C315ECD8-D624-A640-B0B2-4D8ACA0EFF31}&page-id={6F403E49-F810-FE47-B22A-C5760FDC4F97}&end). Since God revealed Himself in diverse manners, he also recognizes God's revelation in nature, providence, and Christian experience as "true and valid" sources.

Karl Barth denies General Revelation and, violently opposed to modern theology's subjectivism, stresses the necessity of Special Revelation for the knowledge of God.

"Some also regard the teaching of the Church or its confessions as the source of theology. Consequently, though both Scripture and tradition may be regarded as sources of theology, only the teachings of the Church, which are irrevocable, constitute the real source and the rule of faith" (Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 2019, 54).

"Under the influence of Friedrich Schleiermacher and Alan Ritschl, it has become customary in many circles to regard the Christian consciousness as the theology, the only source from which it derives its material. For Friedrich Schleiermacher, the church's dogmas are a scientific expression of the pious feelings which the believers, on close and conscientious self-examination, perceive in his heart" (Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 2019, 56).

## Distribution of Dogmatics

### How the Material is Secured and Treated

Theology is speculative and practical, engaging the believer's mind and life. As a speculative discipline, theology seeks to understand and articulate divine truth, exploring God's nature, attributes, and works. This involves careful reasoning, drawing from Scripture, tradition, and philosophical reflection to construct a coherent belief system. Doctrines such as the Trinity, divine providence, and Christ’s two natures are deeply theological inquiries that shape the foundation of Christian thought, even if their immediate application is not always apparent. Speculative theology provides the intellectual structure necessary for faith to be properly grounded, guarding against error and ensuring that theological reflection remains faithful to divine revelation.

Yet theology is not merely an abstract intellectual pursuit but deeply practical. The truths uncovered through theological reflection directly affect worship, ethics, and Christian living. For instance, the doctrine of justification by faith alone is a theological formulation and a reality that transforms how a believer understands salvation and assurance before God. Theology shapes how the church worships, teaches, and ministers, informing pastoral care, moral decision-making, and the believer’s daily walk with God. This way, theology bridges the gap between faith and practice, ensuring that speculative insight leads to practical obedience. A purely speculative theology becomes detached from the church's life, while a strictly practical theology risks becoming shallow and ungrounded. True theology holds both in balance, reflecting on divine truth in a way that transforms belief and behavior.

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"Several methods of obtaining and dealing with theological truth have been suggested and applied, of which the following may be regarded as the most important" (59).

- The Trinitarian Method

- "John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli paved the way for the trinitarian distribution of the dogmatic material. Their classification was not strictly trinitarian but was derived from the Apostolic Confessions. They followed up their discussion of God as Creator, God as Redeemer, and God as Sanctifier" (65).

- This method, with its excessive emphasis on the separate person of the Godhead, tends to obscure the fact that the divine opera ad extra are all opera essentialia, that is, works of the sacred.

- The Analytical Method

- The synthetic method begins with God, then discusses man, Christ, and redemption until it finally reaches the end of all things.

- The Covenantal Method (for this discussion, see [Covenantalism](onenote:https://d.docs.live.net/fc52dea27c35b98d/Documents/Reformed%20Dogmatics/Prolegomena/3%20Hermeneutcal%20Framework.one#3.02%20Covenantalism&section-id={CD8D5A60-908F-4844-8F8C-9B74EB1AB3FF}&page-id={0A2BF002-46AA-CB42-AFBD-5B602C6D6A1C}&end), [Progressive Covenantalism](onenote:https://d.docs.live.net/fc52dea27c35b98d/Documents/Reformed%20Dogmatics/Prolegomena/3%20Hermeneutcal%20Framework.one#3.03%20Progressive%20Covenantalism&section-id={CD8D5A60-908F-4844-8F8C-9B74EB1AB3FF}&page-id={50C5567E-4D30-BB4E-9F2F-F863EEA87969}&end), or [Dispensationalism](onenote:https://d.docs.live.net/fc52dea27c35b98d/Documents/Reformed%20Dogmatics/Prolegomena/3%20Hermeneutcal%20Framework.one#3.04%20Dispensationalism&section-id={CD8D5A60-908F-4844-8F8C-9B74EB1AB3FF}&page-id={3CF5E3A2-7D1E-1C4B-A54E-4E10FD6815E4}&end).

- The Christological Method

- Several theologians study God, and many believe that all genuinely Christian theology should be Christocentric, deriving its distribution principles from Christ or Christ's saving work.

- The Method Based on the Kingdom-Idea

- Alan Ritschl makes the Kingdom of God central in his theology; some theologians would derive the distribution principles from this critical concept. Ritschl himself does not apply this division. Nevertheless, he discusses successively God or the supreme King, man or subject, Christ, redemption or salvation, the way of salvation or the constitution, the Church or the training, and the future coming of the Lord or the consummation of the Kingdom. This division. It is purely formal and is not organically deducted from the Kingdom's idea.

- The Synthetical Method

- This is the only method that will yield the desired unity in Dogmatics. It starts with God and considers everything that comes up for discussion about God. It discusses the various doctrines in their logical order, in which they arise in thought, and which lends itself to the most intelligible treatment.

- For that reason, Anthropology must precede Christology, and Christology must precede Soteriology, and so on. Proceeding according to this logical method:

- Vos, Geerhardus. Biblical Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: NA, 1948.

"Exegetical Theology in the wider sense comprises the following disciplines:

1. The study of the actual content of Holy Scriptures
2. The inquiry into the origin of the several Biblical writings
3. How these several writings came to be collected into the unity of a Bible or book
4. Self-disclosure of God in time and space which lie behind even the first committal of writing of any Biblical documenting

Biblical Theology is that branch of Exegetical Theology which deals with the process of God's self-revelation as recorded in the Bible. Deals with revelation as a divine activity, not as the finished product of that activity.

It has not completed itself in one exhaustive act, but unfolded itself in a long series of successive acts" (5-6).

## Relation to Other Disciplines

- Grudem, Wayne. Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Academic. 2020.

- Philosophical Theology

- Practical Theology

- Old | New Testament Theology (Biblical Theology) " has a technical meaning in theological studies. It is the largest category, encompassing both Old Testament and New Testament theology as we have defined them. Biblical theology gives special attention to the teaching of individual authors and sections of Scripture and the place of each teaching in the historical development of Scripture" (3).

- Historical Theology

The definition provided by Wayne Grudem "will not be on historical theology or philosophical theology, or apologetics. However, these three worthwhile subjects for Christians to pursue are sometimes also included in a broader definition of systematic theology. Some considerations of philosophical and apologetics matters will be found at points throughout" (2)

"Systematic theology uses the material of biblical theology and often builds on the results of biblical theology. As some points, especially where great detail and care are needed in the development of the doctrine, systematic theology will even use a biblical-theological method, analyzing the development of each doctrine through he historical development of Scripture. But the focus of systematic theology remains different; Its focus is on the collection and then he summary of he teaching of all the biblical passages on a particular subject" (3).
