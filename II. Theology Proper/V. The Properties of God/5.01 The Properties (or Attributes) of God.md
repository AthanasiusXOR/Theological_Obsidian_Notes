## What is an Attribute | Evaluation of the Term Used

- Wellum, Stephen. Systematic Theology Volume I. Brentwood, TN: B&H Academic Publishing, 2024.

"An attribute is not something we attribute to God as if it is part of God. Instead, attributes are what God is, in His entire being and perfection, the one God. To speak of God's attributes describes his being or what God is in his undivided essence" (595).

There are no attributes that are "accidental." As humans, we possess accidental attributes that can be lost and new ones that can be gained, yet we remain the same. God does not abide by this.

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The name attribute is not ideal, since it conveys the notion of adding or assigning something to one, and is therefore apt to create the impression that something is added to the divine Being. The term 'properties' is preferable, as it points to something proper to God and God alone (39).

The attributes of God are defined as the perfections which are predicated of the Being of God in Scripture, or are visibly exercised by Him in His works of creation, providence, and redemption" (39).

- DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.

"Divine attributes are qualities or characteristics that can be predicated of God. Some people prefer to speak of God's perfections, virtues, or excellence (1 Peter 2:9). Others use the word "property" to describe what is proper to God. Eastern Orthodox theologians often speak of God's essence and God's energies; just as we cannot land on the sun (essence) but can experience the rays of the sun (energies), we are capable of knowing true things about God even if we cannot plumb the depths of the very God-ness of God" (42-43).

- Grudem, Wayne. Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Academic. 2020.

"We will use the two categories of incommunicable and communicable attributes then, while realizing that they are not entirely precise classifications, and that there is in reality much overlap between the categories" (186).

- Owen, John. *Communion with God*. Banner of Truth Trust, Carlisle, PA: 2024.

"God is light, and we are darkness. God is life, we are dead. God is love, we are enmity" (2).

## Method of Determining the Attributes of God

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

Scholastics, in their attempt to construct a system of natural theology, posited three ways to determine the attributes of God, which they designated as the via causalitatis, via negationis, and eminentiae. By the way of causality, by the way of negation, and by the way of eminence" (39-40). 

--> "This method may appeal to some, because it proceeds from the known to the unknown, but is not the proper method of [[1.04 Task, Method, and Distribution of Dogmatics|theology]]" because it takes its starting point in man. (Berkhof, Systematic Theology, 2021: 0).

"Alan Ritschl wants us to start with the idea that God is love, and would have us ask what is involved in this most characteristic thought of God. His purpose of love is that His will is supremely effective in the world" (40).

Scholastics and Alan Ritschl rely on methods that have exaggerated ideas of their ability to discover God and determine God's nature inductively by approved scientific methods. Therefore, they end up closing their eyes to only His special revelation,  which drags God down to the same level as man, "to stress His Immanence at the expense of His Transcendence, and to make Him continuous with the world" (41).

"The only proper way to obtain perfectly reliable divine attributes is by studying God's self-revelation in Scripture. We can indeed acquire some knowledge of the greatness and power, the wisdom and goodness of God through the study of nature, but for an adequate conception of even those attributes, it will be necessary to turn to the Word of God. In [[2.01 Principia in General|Principia in General]], we seek to learn from the Word of God, which are the attributes of the Being of God, or the essence of God; they include self-existence, immensity, eternity, and so on: omnipresence and omniscience.

Suggested Divisions of the Attributes:

1. Natural and moral - self-existence, simplicity, and infinity belong to the constitutive nature of God, as distinguished from his will.

2. Absolute and relative attributes - all the perfections of God are relative, indicating what He is about the world. Strong does not recognize the objection and gives preference to the division.

3. Immanent/Intransitive and Immanent/Transitive combine the divisions with the preceding ones when we speak of absolute or immanent and relative or transitive attributes, those that do not go forth and operate outside of the divine essence but remain Immanent, such as immensity, simplicity, eternity, and the alter ego, which issue forth and produce effects external to God, as Omnipotence, benevolence, and justice.

4. Incommunicable and Communicable Attributes - this division or classification of the attributes under two main heads, as found in the distinction under consideration, is inherent in all the other divisions, so that they are all subject to the objection that hey apparently divine the Being of God into two parts, that first God as He is in Himself, God as the absolute Being, discussed and then God as He is related to HIs creatures, God as a personal Being.

- DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.

"Some speak of absolute attributes (those properties God has in himself apart from anything else) and relative attributes (the properties he expresses about his creation and his creatures)" (44).

Despite these reservations, the distinction between incommunicable and communicable diseases is too common to be discarded. Additionally, the categories highlight an important distinction. The incommunicable attributes help us to glory in the bigness and otherness of God. In contrast, the communicable attributes shine with more splendor when we consider what sort of God it is who deals with us so kindly and so graciously" (45).

"Everything about God is essential to God; nothing is incidental" (46).

- Horton, Michael. God's Promises: Introducing Covenant Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2006.

"In distinction from pagan mythology, denying any natural connection between the Creator and creature establishes the biblical emphasis on God's transcendence (his incomprehensible majesty). However, the fact that God has chosen to enter into a personal relationship with us using a covenant underscores his Immanence " (29).

- Grudem, Wayne. Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Academic. 2020.

"God is compared to a lion (Isa 31:4), an eagle (Deuteronomy 32:11), a lamb (Isa 53:7),, a hen (Matt 23:37), the sun (Psalms 84:11), the morning star (Revelation 22:16), a light (Psalms 27:1), a torch (Rev 21:23); a fire (Hebrews 12:29), a foundation (Psalms 36:9), a rock (Deuteronomy 32:4), a hiding place (Psalms 119:114), a rower (Prov 36:9), a moth (Psalms 29:11), a shadow (Psalms 91:1), a shield (Psalms 84:11) a temple (Revelation 21:22) and so forth" (187).

"God, who is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions, immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, most wise, most holy, most free, most absolute" (Westminster Confession of Faith, 2.1).

### Divine Simplicity

- Wellum, Stephen. Systematic Theology Volume I. Brentwood, TN: B&H Academic Publishing, 2024.

"God is one. God is one in terms of his singularity: God alone is the true God, and there is no other. God's unity is more than singularity; it is also simplicity. By simplicity, we mean that God is not divisible into parts: His attributes coexist with who he is" (596).

"The importance of divine simplicity for understanding God's attributes cannot be overstated. God's attributes are not abstract qualities that exist independently of Him. God's attributes are identical to his nature. The triune God is absolute perfection" (598).

- DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.

"[The Belgic Confession](https://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/belgic-confession) begins with the declaration that there is a single and simple spiritual being, meaning there is only one God. God is a single being, meaning there is only one God. He is a spiritual being, meaning he is immaterial. And God is a simple being" (48).

"Simple, as a divine attribute, is the opposite of compound" (48).

- Sproul, RC. Truths We Confess: A Systematic Exposition of the Westminster Confession of Faith. Orlando, FL: Reformation Trust, 2019.

"God is a simple being, rather than a complex being who can be divided into parts" (35).

### Transcendence and Immanence

- Wellum, Stephen. Systematic Theology Volume I. Brentwood, TN: B&H Academic Publishing, 2024.

"God's transcendence means that, as Lord, he is exalted above all things, eternal, independent, and self-existent. Scripture teaches that God is transcendent and distinct from the world as its Creator and Lord. And this distinction between God and creation is one of a kind, not merely a degree. God is not the same ontological plan as the universe, and not in any way limited by the universe. God is omnipresent and transcendent; thus, he is not limited by space" (579).

"God's immanence means that he is present with his creation. God as the covenant Lord is not locked out of his creation, and contrary to deism, God is active in the world even though He is not in time and space or limited by them" (579)

There is no inherent tension between God's transcendence and immanence, but this is not universally true, particularly outside of historical Christian theology.

- DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.

"God is infinitely above us and beyond us. That is transcendence. God draws near to us in Christ--not simply as God amid the camp, but as God in human flesh. That is immanence" (59).

## Metaphysical Attributes of Our Triune Covenant Lord (Incommunicable)

Under this category is the discussion of attributes that entail an absolute distinction between God and humanity. These attributes are incommunicable since they underscore God's uniqueness, self-sufficiency, sovereignty, and lordship.

### Aseity

All that God is, he is of himself.

- Wellum, Stephen. Systematic Theology Volume I. Brentwood, TN: B&H Academic Publishing, 2024.

"He makes the following four points by thinking through all that Scripture teaches. First, as Lord, God owns everything because he alone is God. Second, everything we have comes from God because of his free choice to create, rule, and provide for his creation. For this reason, God owes us nothing, and the only reason we have anything from him is his gracious choice to share himself with what he has made, tied to his covenant promises" (604-06).

"Aseity means that God's existence is grounded only in himself" (605).

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"God is self-existent, that is, He has the ground of HIs existence in Himself. The idea of God's self-existence was generally expressed by the term aseity, meaning self-originated, but Reformed theologians quite generally substituted for its the world independent (independence) as expressing, not merely that God is independent in His being, but also that He is independent means in everything else: in His virtues, decrees, works, and so on. As the self-existent God, He is independent in Himself and causes everything to depend on Him" (46).

- DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.

"Divine aseity means God exists in and of himself. He is before all things and on him all things depend. He exists independent of anything or anyone else" (49).

- Grudem, Wayne. Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Academic. 2020.

"God does not need us or the rest of creation for anything, yet we and the rest of creation can glorify him and bring him joy. God is independent and self-sufficient" (190).

### Immutability

- Wellum, Stephen. Systematic Theology Volume I. Brentwood, TN: B&H Academic Publishing, 2024.

"God has fullness of life within himself; he is a se. As such, God cannot change in His being, character, plans, and purposes, since there is nothing outside of Him that He depends on; nature is immutable. God identifies Himself as the eternal "I AM," which entails His immutability. God will never be more powerful, knowing, loving, and holy. God is eternal and unchanging. God can never become morally better or worse than he is. He will never be wiser or more loving. God's plan or decree is eternal and unconditional. God is the promise keeper and maker, a truth always tied to his covenant promises centered in Christ" ( 607-08).

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The Immutability of God is a necessary concomitant of His aseity. It is that perfection of God by which He is devoid of all change, not only in His Being, but also in His perfections, and His purposes and promises. This immutability of God is taught in such passages of Scripture as Exodus 3:14; Psalms 102:26-28; Isa 41:4; 4812; Malachi 3:6; Romans 1:23; Hebrews 1:11, 12; James 1:17" (47).

- DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.

"Immutability, as a divine attribute, means that God does not change" (51).

"We can say that God is immutable in his essence, his knowledge, his will, and his purpose. His nature cannot be altered for better or worse. He does not grow. He does not improve. God does not change" (52).

- Grudem, Wayne. Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Academic. 2020.

"God is unchanging in his being, perfections, purposes, and promises yet God does act and feel emotions, and he acts and feels differently in response to different situations God causes the universe to change, but in the contrast to this change he is the same" (193).

"The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of his heart to all generations" (Psalms 33:11).

"God is unchanging in his promises" (194).

### Impassibility

- Wellum, Stephen. Systematic Theology Volume I. Brentwood, TN: B&H Academic Publishing, 2024.

"God is not like us; he is impassible. God is never anxious, inwardly troubled, compulsive, and so on" (615).

Passion ~~=~~ Affections

"When we think of God in his eternal works (ad extra), we cannot divorce God's affection from his will, knowledge, and power. If God chooses to create and share his love with us, it is due to his eternal plan" (617).

### Eternally | Infinity

- Wellum, Stephen. Systematic Theology Volume I. Brentwood, TN: B&H Academic Publishing, 2024.

"God transcends the very limitations of time: he is the absolute-infinite God about time" (618).

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

God is free from all limitations. He is in no way limited by the universe, but by this time-space world, or confined to the universe. The infinity of God must be conceived as intensive rather than extensive. It should not be confused with boundless extensions, as if God were spread out throughout the entire universe, one part being here and the other there, for God has no body and therefore no extension" (48).

"His eternity may be defined as that perfection of God whereby He is elevated above all temporal limits and all succession of moments, and possesses the whole of His existence in one indivisible present" (48-49).

"It may be defined as that perfection of the [[4.01 The Existence of God|being of God]] by which He transcends all spatial limitations, and yet is present in every point of space with His whole being" (49).

- DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.

"First, God is infinite about himself. We can call this God's absolute perfection. All that God has, he is, and all that God is, he is ad infinitum. Second, God is infinite in time. We can call this God's eternity. He is without beginning and end (Psalm 90:2; 1 Timothy 1:17). Third, God is infinite in space. We can call this God's immensity. He is not constrained by physicality or geographic location" (51).

- Grudem, Wayne. Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Academic. 2020.

"God has no beginning, end, or succession of moments in his being, and he sees all time equally vividly, yet God sees events in time, and he acts in time. To be infinite is to be unlimited, and this doctrine teaches that time does not limit God" (199).

"God somehow stands above time and can see it all plainly in his consciousness. God acts within time and acts differently at different points in time. Paul tells the men of Athens, "The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed (Acts 17:30-31)" (204-05).

- Bray, Gerald. God Has Spoken: A History of Christian Theology. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2024.

"God is being who exists in an objectively conceivable eternity, free of all the limitations of time and space" (110).

- Athanasius of Alexandria. On the Incarnation. ~373. Verbi Dei. London: A.R> Mowbray and Company: 1970.

"God is infinite, not finite, it was not made from pre-existent matter, but out of nothing and out of non-existence absolute and utter God brought into being through the Word" (14).

### Omnipresent

"Theologians use two words to refer to God's relation to space. The first word is immensity; that is, God is without measure. It is a concept that applies to God alone and God within Himself (ad intra), regardless of whether He created a world. The second word is omnipresent, conveying God's relationship to the world He created. Instead of viewing God as located outside of space, it conveys the truth that God's entire being is simultaneously everywhere so that he fills every part of space. Immensity speaks of God's Transcendence, while omnipresence speaks of God's Immanence.

- Grudem, Wayne. Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Academic. 2020.

"God does not have size or spatial dimensions and is present at every point of space with his whole being, yet God acts differently in different places" (206).

- Bray, Gerald. God Has Spoken: A History of Christian Theology. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2024.

"God is omnipresent because he can act anywhere; he is absolute, because there is no power greater than his. God's activity is not remote, or something which was completed after the six days of creation" (56).

"The one who dwells outside time is in our experience always present, because the present is the only mode in which we can experience the eternal" (84).

### Omnipotent

God is omnipotent - infinite in power and able to do everything consistent with his will and nature.

- Wellum, Stephen. Systematic Theology Volume I. Brentwood, TN: B&H Academic Publishing, 2024.

"God did not have to create the world or plan our redemption from sin: those actions are free acts. But his action is no longer optional once God has planned a specific course. This is especially the case regarding his covenantal promises once they are made. God is true to his word" (628).

- DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.

"Although we have classified omnipotence as a communicable attribute, the attribute is, in another sense, incommunicable because our exercise of power is not like God's. No step is necessary between willing and doing when God exercises power. God's power is unlimited" (58).

Bray, Gerald. God Has Spoken: A History of Christian Theology. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2024.

"The Bible presents us with the picture of an omnipotent God who has chosen a particular people and, if only by implication, has excluded the rest of humanity" (92).

- Allison, Gregg. Sojourners and Strangers: The Doctrine of the Church. Wheaton, IL: Crossway: 2012.

"The mighty power of God was made manifest in four events: the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, his session at the authoritative right hand of God the Father in heaven, the subjection of all things under the sovereignty of Christ, and the giving of Christ as head over all things to the church" (111).

## Epistemological Attributes of Our Covenant Lord (Communicable)

In this category, the discussion centers on attributes that remind us that our God is the absolute and final authority, the Lord of knowledge, because He is the source and standard of truth.

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"God is represented in Scripture as Light, and therefore as perfect in His intellectual life. The knowledge of God may be defined as that perfection of God whereby He, in a unique manner, knows Himself of all things possible and actually in one eternal and most simple act" (54).

### Omniscience

- Wellum, Stephen. Systematic Theology Volume I. Brentwood, TN: B&H Academic Publishing, 2024.

"God's omniscience means that God knows everything possible to know" (631).

God knows all things, past, present, and future

1. God's knowledge is intuitive, not discursive
2. God's knowledge is immediate, instantaneous, and non-successive
3. God's knowledge is independent, not dependent on the creature
4. God's knowledge is infallible
5. God's knowledge is infinite, not partial

See [[7.02 Predestination|Predestination]] for information on the Divine-Foreknowledge-Human-Freedom Problem.

- Grudem, Wayne. Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Academic. 2020.

The affirmation of His truthfulness relates to the fact of God's omniscience from Himself. "God's truthfulness means that he is a true God, and that all his knowledge and words are both true and the final standard of truth" (233).

"God fully knows himself and all things actual and possible in one simple and eternal act" (225).

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"God is omniscient, because it is all-comprehensive" (55).

### Wisdom of God

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"Knowledge is acquired by study, but wisdom results from an intuitive insight into things" (57).

- Bray, Gerald. The Doctrine of God: Contours of Christian Theology. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1993.

"First, sin and the fall are realities which God has dealt with according to his wisdom. We may not understand their cause, but we have access to their cure, and it would obviously be silly to reject the latter simply because we cannot fully understand the former" (92).

Wilkins - Session 1

God holds all the wisdom. Wisdom is the facts. He knows the macro and the micro.

We (men) are not responsible for the facts that we don't have.

Wisdom - having the ability to use the available facts and the ability to discern the good from the evil.

1 Kings 3 = Solomon's prayer

James 1:5

God is wisdom (he is full of knowledge), and so when we pray for wisdom, we are asking for discernment, not for decisions. Never is Scripture man praying for expertise but for wisdom. The difference between the two

### Spirituality

- Grudem, Wayne. Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Academic. 2020.

"God is spirit (John 4:24). Jesus speaks this statement in the context of a discussion with the woman at the well in Samaria. The discussion is about the location where people should worship God. Jesus is telling her that true worship of God does not require one to be present either in Jerusalem or Samaria, for true worship has to do not with physical location but with one's inner spiritual condition" (220-21).

### Truthfulness and Faithfulness

- Grudem, Wayne. Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Academic. 2020.

"God's truthfulness means that he is the true God, and all his knowledge and words are both true and final standard of truth" (233).

## Moral Attributes of Our Triune Covenant Lord

- Holiness and Goodness

- Justice and Righteousness

- Love, Grace, Mercy

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The goodness of God should not be confused with His kindness, which is a more restricted concept. God is good in Himself and for His creatures, and may therefore be called the *fons omnium bonorum*" (58). 

The goodness of God toward His creatures in general. That perfection of God which prompts Him to deal bountifully and kindly with all His creatures.

- Grudem, Wayne. Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Academic. 2020.

"God's wisdom means that God always chooses the best goals and means to those goals. He is called the only wise God (Romans 16:27). Job says that God is with us and with God are wisdom and might; he has counsel and understanding" (231).

Goodness: "The goodness of God means that God is the final standard of good, and all that God is and does is worthy of approval." (236).

- Sproul, RC. Truths We Confess: A Systematic Exposition of the Westminster Confession of Faith. Orlando, FL: Reformation Trust, 2019.

"God is infinite in being. We mean that His being has no ontological boundaries. There is no place, zone, or venue that His being does not permeate. His being is everywhere, and that incorporates another attribute of God's omnipresence" (14).

 "A finite mind cannot attain an exhaustive, comprehensive understanding of the infinite, for we lack any reference by which to grasp it" (40).

- Owen, John. *Communion with God*. Banner of Truth Trust, Carlisle, PA: 2024.

"Because Christ is God, his love is eternal. His love is eternal because he is eternal. Christ is the alpha and the omega. Because Christ is God, his love is unchangeable. Because Christ is God, his love is infallible effectual" (71). --> [[11.02 The Nature of Christ | See the Nature of Christ]]
