Communion "generally attached to it in reliigous phraseology. It denotes not merely the interchange of feeling between God in his gracious character and a soul in a state of grace, but the gracious character and a soul in a state of grace, but the gracious relationship upon which this holy interchange is based" 

[[10.01 The Person of Christ]] then, is the foundation of all our communion with God and by the Spirit beleivers now receive boldness of faith" (2).
