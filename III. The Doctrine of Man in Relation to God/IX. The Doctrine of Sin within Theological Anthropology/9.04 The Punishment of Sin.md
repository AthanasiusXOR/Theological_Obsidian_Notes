"The slothful man comes to poverty, the drunkard brings ruin upon himself and his family, the fornicator contracts a loathsome and incurable disease, and the criminal is burdened with shame, and even when leaving the prison walls, finds it extremely hard to make a new start in life. The Bible speaks of such punishments in #Job_4:8; #Psalm_9:15; #Psalm_94:23; #Proverbs_5:22; #Proverbs_23:21; #Proverbs_24:14; #Proverbs_31:3" (255).

"Man is not saved from them by repentance and forgiveness" (255).

"The Bible speaks of penalties, which are in no sense that natural results or consequences of the sin committed #Exodus_32:33; #Leviticus_26:21; #Numbers_15:31; #1_Chronicles_10:13; #Psalm_11:6; #Psalm_75:8; #Isaiah_1:24; #Matthew_3:10; #Matthew_24:51)" (256).

## Natural and Positive Penalties

### Nature and the Purpose of Punishment

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The word punishment denotes pain or suffering inflicted because of some misdeed. More specifically, it may be defined as that pain or loss which is directly or indirectly inflicted by the Lawgiver, in vindication of His justice outraged by the violation of the law" (257).

"The law requires that sin be punished because of its inherent demerit, irrespective of all further considerations" (257).

"The penalty of sin does not proceed from the love and mercy of the Lawgiver but from His justice" (258).

1. To vindicate divine righteousness or justice.
2. To reform the sinner.
3. To deter men from sin.

### The Actual Penalty of Sin

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The penalty with which God threatened man in paradise was the penalty of death. The death here intended is not the death of the body, but the death of man as a whole, death in the scriptural sense of the word" (259).

1. Spiritual Death
2. The sufferings of life
3. Physical Death
4. Eternal Death
