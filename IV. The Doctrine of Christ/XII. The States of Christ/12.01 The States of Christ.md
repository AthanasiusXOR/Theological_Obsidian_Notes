"A state is one's position or status in life, and particularly the forensic relationship to which one stands to the law, while a condition is the mode of one's existence, especially as determined by the circumstances of life" (335).

"The two successive states, humiliation and exaltation, were sometimes two closely linked with he two-natures doctrine--human and divine--thus creating confusion. This is particularly true in the case of Lutheran Christology. For whereas the Scholastics spoke only of a communication of extraordinary divine gifts to the human nature of Christ, the Lutherans, as a result of their doctrine of the Lord's Supper, arrive at the confession that certain divine attributes were given to the human nature" (452). Also see [[18.03 The Lord's Supper|the Lord's Supper]].

"In the theological sense, states refers to Christ's position as determined by his relationship to the law and then the condition that follows from this state. In one state, Christ lived under the law — facing all that was demanded and dished out. In the other state, Christ lived free from the law, having vanquished its curse" (199).

## The Doctrine of the State of Christ in General

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.</mark>

"In the state of humiliation Christ was under the law, not only as a rule of life, but as the condition of the covenant of works (see [[3.02 Covenantalism|Covenantalism]]) and even under the condemnation of the law, but in the state of exaltation He is free from he law, having met the condition of the covenant of works and having paid the penalty of sin" (335).

Throughout history, there has been a debate on the "subject of the states." This is to say that there is a discussion on what the states are.

Historically, the doctrine of Christ’s states—His humiliation and exaltation—was developed in the early church but more sharply defined during the Reformation. The **Reformed tradition** articulated a view in which Christ, as the eternal Mediator, voluntarily entered a state of humiliation through His incarnation, suffering, and death, and then was gloriously exalted in His resurrection, ascension, and heavenly reign, all while continuing His mediatorial role. However, **Lutheran theologians** took a different path, particularly about Christ's humanity and divine attributes. They argued that in the exaltation, Christ’s human nature began to express divine glory fully. Thus, the _state of mediator_—as a distinct role involving humiliation—effectively came to an end. This led to a historical disagreement between the traditions: the Reformed saw Christ’s mediatorial office as ongoing and essential even in exaltation, while the Lutheran tradition tended to tie mediation more closely to Christ's earthly, humiliated ministry. This divergence reflects deeper Christological and sacramental differences that continue to shape theological reflection today.

### The State of Humiliation

"People take various roads toward redemption--magic, mysticism and ecstasy, naturalism, legalism and moralism--but the virtual universality of sacrifice requires explanation. By sacrifice, we understand the religious act in which a person voluntarily offers a material gift to the deity and destroys it in the service of that deity to secure the deity's favor" (423-24).

"What Christ earned by his humiliation was not participation in divinity nor his office as prophet, priest, and king. Scriptures states repeatedly that in the beginning he was with God and himself God #John_1:1; #John_17:5; #Romans_8:3; #2_Corinthians_8:9; #Galatians_4:4; #Colossians_2:9; #Hebrews_1:3 and that from eternity he had been anointed prophet, priest, and king by the Father and was active as such already in the days of the Old Testament" (453).

"Based on #Philippians_2:7,8, reformed theology distinguishes two elements in the humiliation of Christ, namely the *kenosis*, consisting in this that He laid aside the divine majesty, the majesty of the sovereign Ruler of the universe, and assumed human nature in the form of a servant: and the *tapeinosis*, consisting in that He became subject to the demands and to the curse of the law, and in His entire life became obedient in action and suffering to the very limit of a shameful death" (336).

"The state of humiliation is the state wherein Christ laid aside his divine majesty, assumed human nature in the form of a servant, and became voluntarily subject to the demands and the curse of the law" (199).

"Sinlessness involves two elements:

First, Christ was free of actual sin. He betrays no consciousness of guilt. He never prays for forgiveness. He never confesses shortcomings. On the contrary, all he did, thought, or said conformed exactly to the will of God. He fulfilled all righteousness #Matthew_3:15.

Secondly, he was free from inherent sin. Nowhere in the structures of his being was there any sin. Satan had no foothold in him. There was no lust. There was no affinity with sin. There was no proclivity to sin. There was no possibility of temptation from within. In no respect, he was fallen and in no respect was his nature corrupt" (221-22).

"Christ was not like us. He was not tempted by anything within himself. He was not dragged away by his own evil desire and enticed (James 1:14). Although Jesus had no vices, he did have sinless human weaknesses. He could be tempted (clearly was) through hunger, through the fear of pain, and through love for a friend. It is not a mark of fallenness to feel any of these, and yet each of them could generate strong pressure to deviate from the path prescribed for him" (226).

### The Incarnation and Birth of Christ

"it was our sorry case that caused the Word to come down, our transgression that called out His love for us, so that He made haste to help us and to appear among" (16).

"The presence and love of the Word had called them into being; inevitably, therefore, when they lost the knowledge of God, they lost existence with it; for it is God alone Who exists, evil is non-being, the negation and antithesis of good" (16).

"The incorporeal, incorruptible, and immaterial Word of God entered the world. In one sense, indeed, He was not far from it before for no part of creation had ever been without Him Who, while ever abiding in union with the Father, yet fills all things that are" (21).

"The pre-existent Son of God assumes human nature and takes to himself human flesh and blood, a miracle that passes our limited understanding. It clearly shows that the infinite can and does enter into finite relations, and that the supernatural can in some way enter the hostile life" ( 337).

"Since the days of Scholastics, the question has been debated, whether the incarnation should be regarded as involved in the doctrine of redemption, or as already involved in the idea of creation. If a Mediator is necessary now, He must have been necessary also before the fall. Moreover, Christ's work is not limited to the atonement and HIs saving operations. He is Mediator, but also Head; He is not only he archetypal but also the *telos* of creation #1_Corinthians_15:45-47; #Ephesians_1:10; 21-23; #Ephesians_5:31; #Colossians_1:15-17)" (338).

"It was the essential goodness of matter that made it possible for the Son of God to become a man" (165).

"The Son had become a man to pay the price of human sin, to overcome the power of death, and to make it possible for anyone who believed in him to have eternal life. Jews and Romans had come together in an effort to stamp out God's revelation of himself in Christ, but his resurrection from the dead showed that they were powerless to do so. Instead of moldering in a borrowed tomb, the Son of God ascended into heaven, took up his seat at the right hand of the Father, and ruled the world whether the imperial authorities liked it or not" (213).

Mary's "pregnancy is an act of divine grace, explicable not in terms of human insemination (nor of a mythical act of divine being) but in terms of the creative power of the Holy Spirit" (27).

"It is the sign that accompanies and indicates the mystery of the incarnation of the Son, marking it off as a mystery from all the beginnings of other human existence" (36).

 "The virgin birth is God's gracious declaration at the very outset of the gospel, that the act of faith is a legitimate sacrificium intellectus. The virgin birth is a sign of God's judgment on human nature" (37).

"The immunity is the virgin birth. Adam begot a son in his own image (Genesis 5:3). But Adam did not beget Christ. The Lord's existence has nothing to do with Adamic desire or Adamic initiative. Christ is new. He is from outside. He is not a derivative from, or a branch of, Adam. He is parallel to the first man, a new departure, and as such not involved in the guilt which runs in the original stream" (41).

"The result of the Son of God taking human nature was that both the human nature and the divine nature were joined together in his one person, never to be separated, not even when Christ's human soul was separated from his human body in the grace" (28).

"The moment the human nature of Christ was created in the Virgin's womb by the Holy Spirit, it was immediately[[15.05 Sanctification| sanctified]], and filled with grace according to its capacity to receive. Not being begotten by natural generations, Christ did not[[9.03 The Transmission of Sin | inherit]] a sinful nature. His human nature was filled with all grace by the Holy Spirit, #Isaiah_11:1-3; #Hebrews_7:26; #Luke_1:35; #John_3:34" (33).

"The phrase descended into hell to the extent that it may have been derived from texts such as #Acts_2:27; #Romans_10:7; #Ephesians_4:9 has historically acquired a very different meaning from what is contained in these texts" (447).

"It was the servant-life of the Lord of Hosts, the life of the Sinless One in daily association with sinners, the life of the Holy One in the sin-cursed world" (341).
### The State of Exaltation

"For Christ, his death was the end of his humiliation and, at the same time, the road to his exaltation" (449).

"All this is neatly summarized in #Philippians_2:6-11, which teaches that because Jesus humbled himself unto death, God has exalted him and given him a name above all names." See the [[11.01 The Names of Christ|names of Christ]](451).

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.</mark>

"In exaltation the God-man, Jesus Christ passed from under the law in its federal and penal aspects, and consequently from under the burden of the law as the condition of the covenant of works, and from under the curse of the law; exchanged the penal for the righteous relation tot he law and as Mediator entered into possession of the blessings of salvation which He for sinners; and was crowned with a corresponding honor and glory" (349).

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.</mark>

"The state of exaltation is the state wherein Christ passed from under the penalty and the burden of the law, came to possess all the blessings of salvation, and was crowned with glory and honor" (199).

#### The Stages of Exaltation

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.</mark>

1. The Resurrection: "The resurrection of Christ did not consist in the mere fact that He came to life again, and that body and soul were reunited" (351).

- The resurrection has a threefold significance:

- It constituted a declaration of the Father that the last enemy had been vanquished, the penalty paid, and the condition on which life was promised, met.

- It symbolized what was destined to happen to the members of Christ's mystical body in their justification, spiritual birth, and future resurrection #Romans_6:4; #Romans_9:11; #1_Corinthians_6:14; #1_Corinthians_15:20-22; #2_Corinthians_4:10; #Colossians_2:12; #1_Thessalonians_4:14).

2. The Ascension: The ascension does not stand out as boldly on the pages of the Bible as the resurrection does. The ascension may be described as the visible ascent of the person of the Mediator from earth to heaven, according to His human nature.

3. The Session at the Right Hand of God: He predicted He would sit at the right hand of power #Matthew_26:64.

4. The Physical Return of Christ: The highest point is not reached until He who suffered at the hands of man returns in the capacity of Judge. He pointed to this as a special mediatorial prerogative #John_5:22 and so did the apostles #Acts_10:42; #Acts_17:31).

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Bavinck, Herman. Reformed Dogmatics: Abridged in One Volume. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2011.</mark>

"If, in keeping with the Reformed confession, the descent into hell belongs to he state of humiliation, we may distinguish in the exaltation four so-called steps: the resurrection, the ascension, the seating at God's right hand, and the return for judgment" (453).

Resurrection is the first step in Christ's exaltation. Raised by the power of God, he is the firstborn of all creation, the one who has the keys of death and Hades, the one who has the power to give eternal life. Death, as it were, ensnared Christ with its pains, but those pangs were the labor pains of the resurrection, which God would undo in the moment of resurrection. He can never die because death no longer has dominion over him #Romans_9:6)" (454-55).

## Communion with Christ --> The Husbandry Relationship

[[5.02 Communion with the Triune God | See the Communion with the Triune God]] --> provides more information on the communion with the Lord. Here we focus on the Husband-Wife Relationship in which Jesus and the Church form.

"It is the gladness of the heart of Christ, the joy of his soul, to take poor sinners into this relationship with himself. He rejoiced in the thoughts of it from eternity #Proverbs_8:31)" (63).

"Christ commits himself to the soul, to love, care for, and show kindness to it as a husband does to his wife. The soul, in response, gives itself up wholly to the Lord Christ to be to him a loving, tender, obedient wife" (64).

"This relationship begins with Christ giving himself to the soul to be tis Savior, Head, and Husband to dwell with that soul forever" (64)"
