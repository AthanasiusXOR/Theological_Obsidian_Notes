"It has become customary to speak of three offices in connection with the work of Christ, namely the prophetical, the priestly, and the kingly office. While some of the early Christian fathers already spoke of the different offices of Christ, John Calvin was the first to recognize the importance of distinguishing the three offices of the Mediator and to call attention" (362).

## The Prophetic Office

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

The Old Testament uses three words to designate a prophet, namely *nabhi, ro'eh,* and *chozeh*. The words "ro'3h" and "chozeh" emphasize that the prophet receives revelations from God, particularly in the form of visions. These works are used interchangeably (364).

The prophet speaks forth from God. From these names, taken together, we gather that a prophet sees things, that is, who receives revelations, who is in the service of God, particularly as a messenger, who speaks in HIs name.

Exodus 7:1 and Deuteronomy 18:18 indicate that there are two elements in the prophetic function, the one passive and the other active, the one receptive and the other productive. The prophet receives divine revelation in dreams, visions, or verbal communications, and passes these on to the people, either orally or visibly in prophetic actions (Numbers 12:6-8; Isaiah 6; Jeremiah 1:4-10; Ezekiel 3:1-4).

The prophet must reveal God's will to the people.

Proofs from Scripture: He is foretold as a prophet in Deuteronomy 18:15; a passage that is applied to Christ in Acts 3:22. He speaks of Himself as a prophet in Luke 13:33. He claims to bring a message from the Father (John 8:26-28; 12:39; 14:10; 15:15; 17:8). He speaks with (Matthew 7:9) and his mighty works served to authenticate His message (Matthew 21:11; Luke 7:16; 24:19; John 3:2; 4:19; 6:14; 7:40).

"The prophetic office combined a passive and active function. Passively, the prophet received divine revelation. Actively, he revealed to others what God had given to him. The prophet's role was broad: he warned and admonished, he comforted and encouraged, he rebuked, he called for repentance, he comforted and encouraged, he rebuked, he gave assurance of grace, he made known God's will, he announced God's commands, he spoke of coming blessing and threatened coming judgement" (211).

## The Priestly Office

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The Bible makes a broad but important distinction between a prophet and a priest. Both receive their appointment from God (Deuteronomy 18:18; Hebrews 5:4). But the prophet was appointed to be God's representative with the people, to be His messenger, and to interpret His will. He was primarily a religious teacher. The priest, on the other hand, was man's representative with God" (367).

See Hebrews 5:1: "the priest is taken from among men to be their representatives; God appoints him and he is active in the interest of men in things that pertain to God, that is, in religious things, his special work is to offer gifts and sacrifice for sins. But the work of the priest included even more than that. He also made intercession for the people (Hebrews 7:25) and blessed them in the name of God (Leviticus 9:22)" (367).

Christ's priestly work is twofold. "His foremost task was to offer an all-sufficient sacrifice for the sin of the world. It belonged to the office of priest that he should offer gifts and sacrifices for sin" (368).

Christ's sacrifices and the priestly office are typological in nature. There are other views, however:

1. The gift theory: sacrifices were presented to establish good relations.

2. The sacramental-communion theory is a totemistic idea that reverences an animal, which was supposed to share in the divine nature.

3. The homage theory: where sacrifices were an expression of homage and dependence.

"The sacrificial work of Christ was symbolized and typified in the Mosaic sacrifices. Their expiatory and vicarious natures. They were gifts to please God, to express gratitude to Him, or to placate His wrath, and they were essentially sacrificial meals symbolizing communion between Man and God. The Mosaic sacrifices had not only ceremonial and symbolical, but also spiritual and typical significance" (373-75).

"A special class of priests--holy persons who effect and maintain communion with God--also gradually arose in all religions to offer sacrifices and serve as mediators. Having lost their priestly roles, human beings felt a need for special persons to take their place and plead their case before God" (424).

Jesus offered a perfect sacrifice for sin. This was a completed and final sacrifice, never to be repeated, a theme frequently emphasized in the book of Hebrews (7:27; 9:12; 10:1-2, 10, 12, 14; 13:12).

- DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.

"Christ's work as priest chiefly consists of two things: atonement and intercession. The nature of Christ's ongoing intercession is manifold. Christ not only prays for us; his perpetual presence in heaven is itself part of his mediatorial work (Hebrews 7:25; 8:1-4: 9:24)" (212).

## The Kingly Office

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"As the Second Person in the triune God, the eternal Son, Christ, naturally shares the dominion of God over [[7.03 Creation|Creation]], His throne is established in heaven and His kingdom ruleth over all (Psalm 103:19)" (415).

"The spiritual nature of this kingship is indicated, among others, by the fact that Christ is repeatedly called the Head of the Church (Ephesians 1:22; 4:15; 5:23; Colossians 1:18; 2:19). This term, as applied to Christ, is in some cases practically equivalent to King as in 1 Corinthians 11:3; Ephesians 1:22; 5:23: however, it is used in a literal and organize essence (Ephesians 4:15; Colossians 1:18; 2:19)" (415).

The kingdom has the following characteristics:

- It is grounded in the work of redemption.
- It is a spiritual Kingdom.
- It is a kingdom that is both present and future.
- It is closely related to the Church, though not altogether identical with it.
