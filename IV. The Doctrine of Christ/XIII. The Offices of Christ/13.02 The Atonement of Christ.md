"It is God himself who brings about reconciliation in Christ #2_Corinthians_5:19. By Christ's sacrifice, a new relation of reconciliation and peace has been accomplished between God and humanity. The benefit of this work of Christ is unrestricted; it covers every dimension of experience; it extends to all creation" (459).

1. Christ's work of atonement is an aspect of his priestly work.
2. Christ's work of atonement is primarily objective and only secondarily subjective.
3. The atonement is based on the active and passive obedience of Christ.
4. The motivation for the atonement is not one thing but many things.
5. Christ's work of atonement is at the heart of the gospel and the minimum of the apostolic message of salvation.

There are two ways in which the atonement can be theorized:

1. Recapitulation (Irenaeus) - Christ lived out all the stages of human life in such a way that his life of obedience compensated for Adam's life of disobedience.
2. Ransom to Satan (Origen) - Christ's death is seen as a ransom to purchase man's freedom.
3. Commercial (Anselm) - Christ's death brought infinite honor to God. God gave Christ a reward, which He passed on to man in the form of forgiveness and eternal life.
4. Moral influences (Abelard) - Christ's death showed God's great love, which in turn gave man the impetus to repent and believe.
5. Example (Socinus) - Christ's death was an example of obedience and piety that can inspire man to the same virtues.
6. Government (Grotius) - Christ's death demonstrates that the law must be upheld and sin must be punished. His death is not a vicarious sacrifice but a way for God to maintain his moral governance of the universe.
7. Mystical theory (Schleiermacher) - like the moral influence, this mode is meant to effect a change in man. This theory argues that a change was wrought in man deep in his subconsciousness.
8. Vicarious Repentance (Campbell) - Christ's identification with us. Christ lived a life of self-sacrifice, identified with us by suffering on the cross, and repented on our behalf, thereby leading God to be merciful to sinners.
9. Elect and effective (Barth) - since Christ assumed human nature, his death must have been intended for all those with that nature.
10. Penal Substitution (Protestant Reformers) - emphasized by Calvin and Luther, but traces can also be found in Martyr and Tertullian. Christ's death was a substitutionary sacrifice meant to satisfy the demands of God's justice.

"The great and central part of the [[13.01 The Offices of Christ|Office of Christ]] is that of Priest. This lies in the atonement, but this is not complete with the [[13.03 The Intercessory Work of Christ|Intercessory Work of Christ]]. His sacrificial work on earth called for His service in the heavenly sanctuary" (374).

"Man is utterly unable to make any atonement with God for sin. God has said that no sacrifice, even those he appointed, could atone for sin #Hebrews_10:11; #Hebrews_9:9. Rejecting these sacrifices, Christ in their stead says, Behold I have come, to do your will, O God #Hebrews_10:6-8. So it is by Christ that we are justified from all things from which we could not be justified by the law #Acts_13:39" (105).

## The Cause and Necessity of the Atonement

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"Jesus offered Himself as a victim in their stead, paid the is view prompts men by laying down His life for transgressors, and thus pacified an angry God. This view prompts men to laud Christ for His supreme self-sacrifice, but at the same time, to blame God for demanding and accepting such a price" (374).

- #Isaiah_53:10 - It was predicted that Jesus would come into the world to carry out the good pleasure of God.
- #John_3:16 - God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believeth in Him should not perish.
- #Galatians_1:4 - for the good pleasure of the Father that Jesus should in all fullness dwell and through Him to reconcile all things unto Himself.

**Not in the arbitrary will of God.**

"In #Romans_3:24, 25, we find both elements combined: Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of past sins, through the forbearance of God. This representation guards against the idea of an arbitrary will" (375).

"It would seem to be clear teaching of Scripture that God, in virtue of His divine righteousness and holiness, cannot simply overlook defiance to His infinite, but must visit sin with punishment. We are told repeatedly that He will by no means clear the guilty #Exodus_34:7; #Numbers_14:18; #Nahum_1:3. He hates sin with a divine hatred; His whole being reacts against it #Psalm_5:4-6; #Nahum_1:2; #Romans_1:18)" (377).

"The majesty and absolute immutability of the divine law as inherent in the very nature of God made it necessary for Him to demand satisfaction of the sinner. The transgressions of the law inevitably carry with them a penalty. God wanted to save the sinner, even though the latter could not meet the demands of the law; He had to make provision for a vicarious satisfaction as a ground for the sinner's justification" (377).

"When Adam entered into the covenant of works, He decreed that death would be the penalty of disobedience. That principle finds expression in many other words of Scripture, such as #Ezekiel_18:4; #Romans_6:23. The veracity of God demanded that the penalty should be executed, and if sinners were to be saved, it should be executed in the life of a substitute" (378).

An objection to the doctrine of the absolute necessity of the atonement: **this makes God inferior to man.** "Man can and often does freely forgive those who wrong him, but, according to the view under consideration, God cannot forgive until He has received satisfaction. This means that He is less good and less charitable than sinful man" (378).

"It is easy to overlook the importance of the fact that the atoning sacrifice which the Son offered to the Father was both acceptable to, and accepted by, hm. It was the Father's acceptance that gave the Son's sacrifice its validity--not the degree of pain that the Son suffered, or even his willingness to get to the cross" (154).

- Grudem, Wayne. Systematic Theology. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Academic. 2020.

"But once God, in his love, decided to save some human beings, then several passages in Scripture indicate that there was no other way for God to do this than through the death of his Son. The atonement was not necessary, but as a consequence of God's decision to save some human beings, the atonement was essential" (706).

## The Nature of the Atonement

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The doctrine of the atonement here presented is the penal substitionary or satification doctrine, which is the doctrine taught by the Word of God" (380).

"The reconciled God justifies the sinner who accepts the, and so operates in his heart by the Holy Spirit, that the sinner also lays aside his wicked alienation from God, and thus enters into the fruits of the perfect atonement of Christ. The fact that Christ reconciles God to the sinner results in a reflex action on the sinner, in virtue of which the sinner may be said to be reconciled to God" (380).

"The priests in their sacrificial and intercessory work represented men in the presence of God, and therefore looked in a Godward direction" ( 381).

"The blood of the sacrifice is interposed between God and the sinner, and given it, the wrath of God is turned aside" (381).

The words *katalasso* and *katalage* signify "to reconcile" and "reconciliation". They point to an action by which enmity is changed to friendship, and surely have, first of all, an objective signification. The offender reconciles, not himself, but the person whom he has offended" (382).

"There are several passages in Scripture, which speak of our sins as being laid upon Christ and of His bearing sin or iniquity #Isaiah_53:6; #John_1:29; #2_Corinthians_5:21; #Galatians_3:13; #Hebrews_9:28; #1_Peter_2:24)" (384).

"Christ as Mediator entered the federal relation in which Adam stood in the state of integrity, to merit eternal life for the sinner. This constitutes the active obedience of Christ, consisting in all that Christ did to observe the law in its federal aspect, as the condition for obtaining eternal life" (387).

## The Purpose and the Extent of the Atonement

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The atonement was destined to affect the relation of God to the sinner, [[12.01 The States of Christ|state of Christ]], and conditions as the Mediatorial author of salvation, and the state and condition of the sinner" (401).

"The atonement secured a manifold reward for Christ as Mediator. He was constituted the life-giving Spirit, the inexhaustible source of all the blessings of salvation for sinners. He received:

 - All that belonged to His glorification, including His present Messianic glory.
 - The fullness of those gifts and graces which He imparts to His people.
 - The gift of the Holy Spirit for the formation of His mystical body and the subjective application of the fruits of His atoning work.
 - The end of the earth for His possession and the world for HIs dominion" (401-02).

"Christ, the tree of life, would never have become available to human beings had Adam not sinned; therefore, so this argument runs, even sin ultimately furthers the purposes of God and is subject to his omniscient power and will" (90).

- DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.

"The doctrine of limited atonement teaches that Christ effectively redeems from every people's only those who were chosen from eternity to salvation." (Canons of Dort, 2.8). The death of Christ was sufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world, but God willed that it should effectively redeem those and only those who were chosen from eternity and given to Christ by the Father" (227).

- Sproul, RC. Truths We Confess: A Systematic Exposition of the Westminster Confession of Faith. Orlando, FL: Reformation Trust, 2019.

"Christ died specifically for the elect and only for the elect. God gave His Son a certain number of people, and Christ laid down His life for them. The atonement is efficacious only for those whom the Father gives to the Son. That text #John_6:35-40 is unpopular because contemporary evangelicalism assumes that Christ died for everyone's sin" (20).

- Sir Basil the Great. On the Holy Spirit. Trans. Stephen Hildebrand. Yonkers, NY: Saint Vladimir's Seminary Press, 2011.

"Our God and Savior's plan for man is his restoration from the fall and his return from the alienation of disobedience to kindship with God. And so that man who is saved receives back that original adopted sonship by imitating Christ" (66).
