"Who is not lifted in his soul and who does not raise his thought to the highest nature when he hears the names of the Spirit? For he is called the Spirit of God #Matthew_12:28), Spirit of truth, who comes forth from the Father #John_15:26, Spirit of righteousness #Psalm_50:12, and directing Spirit #Psalm_50:14. He is rightfully and properly called Holy Spirit, which is above all the names for everything incorporated, purely immaterial, and indivisible" (52-53).

"He lives, but not because he has been restored to life; rather, he is the source of life. He is the source of holiness. The Spirit is present to each one who is fit to receive him, as if he were present to him alone, and still he sends out grace that is complete and sufficient for all" (53).

"Now, those who have been sealed by the Holy Spirit for the day of redemption, and who preserve undiminished and inviolate the first fruit which they have received from the Spriit are the ones who will hear, well done, good and faithful servant, you were faithful in ta few things, I will establish you over many" (74-75).

"The biblical words for spirit are onomatopoeic terms, both their physical formation and their sound conveying a sense of their basic meanings: the expulsion of wind or breath, the idea of air in motion" (16).

"Those who are the subjects of the activity of the divine ruach act in supernatural ways, with supernatural energy and powers" (17).

"Yet the context of Genesis 1:2 suggests that the ruach elohim does not stand in an antithetical relationship to the creating agent. The further clear reference #Genesis_1:1, 3) to the activity of elohim as creative divine activity suggests that the most natural reading of elohim in verse 2 is in terms of divine activity. #Isaiah_63:7-14 clearly identifies the Spirit as the executive of the Exodus" (19).

"The divine ruach is the mode of God's power-presence among his people" (21).

"The Spirit refers to his nature of essence which is pur, spiritual, immaterial #John_4:24. He is the breath of the Lord #Psalm_33:6, #Psalm_18:15, #John_20:22, #Genesis_1:27. He is called the Holy Spirit, #Psalm_51:11, #Isaiah_63:10, #Romans_1:4. He is the Spirit of God, #Psalm_143:10, #Nehemiah_9:20, #Exodus_31:3, #Exodus_25:31, #1_Corinthians_12:6; #2_Samuel_23:2, #2_Peter_1:21. He is the Spirit of God and the Spirit of the Lord, #Genesis_1:2; #John_20:17. He is the Spirit of the Son, the Spirit of Christ, #Galatians_4:6, #1_Peter_1:11, #Romans_8:9.

God sends him to us, #Psalm_104:30, #John_14:26, #John_15:26, #John_16:7. This senindg implies that the Holy Spirit was not with a person before he was sent to him. It tells us that this is a special work of God which he had not done before" (13).

"It is the Holy Spirit who replaces Christ's bodily absence and who brings to fulfillment all the promises made to the church. As the Holy Spirit represents CHirst and takes his place, so he does everything that Christ did for his disciples #John_16:13-15" (42).

- DeMarest, Bruce. *The Cross and Salvation: The Doctrine of Salvation*. Crossway, Wheaton, IL: 1997.

Salvation in the OT:
- Salvation = be saved, be delivered, deliver, give victory, help, deliverance, salvation

Salvation in the NT:
- Salvation = rescue, deliver, save, salvation, redeemer, deliverer, savior

"Thus the Greek wor group commonly bears the theolgical meaning of deliverance from sin, death and the Devil and the gift of eternal life, #Luke_1:69; #Luke_1:71; #Luke_18:26; #Acts_4:12; #Romans_10:9; #1_Thessalonians_5:9; #Hebrews_9:28. In the NT God is the Savior, #Luke_1:47; #1_Timothy_1:1; #_Timothy_2:3; #Titus_1:3; #Titus_2:10; #Titus_3:4, in that the divien Father planned the gift of salvation and sent his only Son into the world on a saving mission" (26).

God in eternity past chose his people for salvation, #1_Peter_1:1; #1_Peter_2:0, and in time he gave them new life through their response of fiath (27).

Scripture is clear in asserting that every lst person in the world succumbs to sin, #Pslam_53:1; #Jeremiah_17:9; #Romans_3:10; #Romans_5:12, and consequently experiences moral corruption, estrangement from God, forfeiture of eternal life and everlasting punishment (28).

## Various Intepretations of Salvation

- DeMarest, Bruce. *The Cross and Salvation: The Doctrine of Salvation*. Crossway, Wheaton, IL: 1997.

"Roman Catholic argue that the visible church, which was founded on Peter, #Matthew_16:18-19, and transmitted to hsi successors, the bishops, mediates salvation to its adherents. Catholicism inists that the supernatural benefits of Chirsts' sacrifice are conveyed physically through the church's sacraments. The sacraments of [[18.02 Christian Baptism | baptism]] is said to remit original sin, impart sanctifying grace, and unite the soult to Christ. Viewed as persoanl transfomration, salvation is progressively realized throughout the lifetime of the baptized (31-32).

"Theological liberalis denies supernaturalism, miracles, biblical authority, and other classifcal docutrines of the faith. The tradition commonly rejects the fall of the race, human depravity, divien wrath, Christs substitutionary atonement, and the need for definitive, individual conversion. Salvation amounts to the moral transformation of persons by right conduct and good works stimuluated by the teachings and examples of Jesus" (32).

Christian existentialism focus is anthropocentric rather than theocentric, and its centers on the individual  rather than on the group or community" (33).

Liberation theology view salvation collectively as the overthrow of unjust and corrupting social structures by revolutin and iolence (33).

Barthian neoorthodoxy held that Christ objectively wrought salvation for all people by hs victory on the cross. Christ's death on the cross the world's sin was judged and in his resurrection the race was vindicated. Barth envisaged faith, repentence, and obedience as manifestations of a finsihed slvation rather than as the means by which the salvation is personally realized (34).

Arminians inists that universal, prevenient grace flwoing from Chirst's cross trnasform sinners in the first momen of moral light, thereby nullifying the debilitating effects of depravity, restoring moral free agency, convicting sin. Arminians emphasize that the grace and calling of God are resistible, hence sinners may choose to reject Christ and continue in their sin (34).
## Ordo Salutis

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The ordo salutis describes the process by which the work of salvation, wrought in Christ, is subjectively realized in the earths and lives of sinners" (426).

"The Bible does not give us a clear-cut ordo salutis; it does do two things which enable us to construe such an order. (1) It furnishes us with a very complete and rich enumeration of the operations of the Holy Spirit in applying the work of Christ to individual sinners, and of the blessings of salvation imparted to them. Words as regeneration, calling, conversion, and renewal repeatedly serve to designate the whole change that is brought about in the inner life of man. It teaches that we are justified by faith and not by works #Romans_3:30; #Romans_5:1; #Galatians_2:11-20) that being justified, we have peace with God and access to Him (Romans 5:1, 2)  that we are set free from sin to become servants of righteousness, and to reap the fruit of sanctification #Romans_8:11-17; #Galatians_4:4 that faith comes by the hearing of the word of God (Romans 10:17) that death unto the law results in life unto God #Galatians_2:19 that when we believe, we are sealed with the Spirit of God #Ephesians_4:1  that having obtained the righteousness of God by faith, we share the sufferings of Christ, and also the power of His resurrection #Philippians_3:9 and that we are begotten again through the Word of God (427).

"The term [[15.03 Justification|justification]] is generally limited to what is called justification by faith, but is sometimes made to cover an objective justification of the elect in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the imputation of the righteousness of Christ to them in the pactum salutis. The word regeneration, which now generally designates that act of God by which He imparts the principle of the new life to man, is also used to designate the new birth or the first manifestation of the new life, and in the theology of the seventeenth century, it frequently occurs as synonymous with conversion or even [[15.04 Sanctification|sanctification]]. Some speak of it as passive conversion in the distinction from [[15.01 Conversion|conversion]] proper, which is then called active conversion" (429).

Typical Reformed Ordo Salutis (simplified):

1. Election – God’s eternal choice of specific individuals for salvation #Ephesians_1:4–5
2. Effectual Calling – The gospel call made effective by the Holy Spirit #Romans_8:30
3. Regeneration – The new birth or being made spiritually alive #John_3:3–8
4. Conversion – Repentance and faith, enabled by regeneration #Acts_20:21
5. Justification – God’s declaration of righteousness based on Christ’s merit #Romans_5:1
6. Adoption – Becoming children of God #Galatians_4:4–7
7. Sanctification – The ongoing transformation into Christ’s likeness #1_Thessalonians_4:3
8. Perseverance – God's preservation of the believer to the end #Philippians_1:6

"Paul presents a broad outline of the plan of salvation in #Romans_8:28-30, popularly knownas the golden circle of salvation. God's foreknowledge and predestiantion undergird other aspects of salvation, givne here a calling, justification, and glorification. Verse 31-39 aafirm the certainty of God's perservation of elect believers" (40).

#1_Corinthians_1:26-30 Pual gives the order of salvation as God's choosing or election, calling, union with Christ, justification, and sanctification.

#Ephesians_1:11-14 is election through Christ the Redeemer, faith defines as hope in Chirst, union with Chtrist, sealing with the Spirit and glorification, viewed as the final redemption. 
 
#2_Thessalonians_2:13-15 the following order is evident: election as the act of God's choosing, belief in the truth, caling through the Gospel, and glorification. Versee 15 upholds the need for perseverance in the faith. 

#2_Timothy_1:8-10 Paul writes of grace that undergird election viewed as God's saving purpose, caling, sanctification, as the holy life, future glorifcation, here designated as life and immortality. 

#1_Peter_1:1-2 delineates the order of salvation as foreknowledge, election, effectual calling expressed as the sanctifying work of the Spirit, fiath identified as obedience to Jesus Christ, and justification and sanctifcation both perhaps implied by the phrase sprinkling by his blood. 

#2_Peter_1:9-11 discussess, election, caling justification, perseverance and glorification. 

#Titus_2:11-14 refers to saving grace, sanctification of life, and glorification.

#Acts_26:18 sets forht the ordr of effectual calling, conversion, and positional sanctification or justification. 

#John_6:44,45 gives the order effectual calling and coming to Christ in faith.

#2_Peter_1:2-4 cites the doctrines of grace, effectual calling, faith, union with Christ and sanctification, although the precise order is less intentional in this text.

#1_Thessalonians_5:23-24 presents the sequence as effectual callng, sanctification, preservation.

**For more, see pages 41-43**

"The order of salavtion inlcudes thigns that God does (election, calling, justification, regeneration, etc) as wll as things that humans do (belief, repenteance, trust, perseverance). The ordo must be viewed as a logicial a well as chronological relation. [[15.01 Conversion Conversion]], [[15.02 Faith | regeneration]], [[14.04 The Mystical Union | union with Christ]], and [[15.03 Justification | justification]] occur simulatenously in the metn of the deciion for Christ, and not successively. Berkouwer and Hoekema point out aspects of the savlation experience are interactive. Thus faith is active in justification, in [[15.04 Sanctification | sanctification]], and in [[16.01 Perseverance of the Saints | perseverance]]. Union with Christ, (abiding in him) is essential for sanctiication and perseverance" (43).

The Order of salvation must not be viewed simplistically as a linear sequence of chronologicla occurrences. Eery aspect of salvation profoudnign focuses on Christ" (43).

- DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.

"The order salutis helpfully reminds us that salvation is a unitary process with various aspects and movements (though we may not be conscious of each step). We can distinguish between what man does ([[15.02 Faith|faith]] and repentance) and what God alone does (regeneration and [[15.03 Justification|justification]]). We can distinguish between judicial acts, filial acts, and acts of moral renewal ([regeneration](onenote:15%20Conversion.one#15.05%20Regeneration&section-id={F8CD53B3-A05C-D245-8311-C76986D06AAC}&page-id={4FB9E8EE-95DB-4547-A426-562751A2BFC5}&end&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/fc52dea27c35b98d/Documents/Reformed%20Dogmatics/V.%20The%20Doctrine%20of%20Applied%20Salvation) and [[15.04 Sanctification|sanctification]]). We can distinguish between elements of our salvation that are instantaneous (regeneration, definitive sanctification) and ongoing elements (progressive sanctification, preserve acne" (235-36).

- Sproul, RC. Truths We Confess: A Systematic Exposition of the Westminster Confession of Faith. Orlando, FL: Reformation Trust, 2019.

"Romans 8:29-30, this text mentions elements of the ordo salutis, foreknowledge, predestination, calling, justification, and glorification. But faith is not mentioned here, nor is sanctification" (91).

- Parsons, Burk, editor. Table Talk Magazine: Bondage of the Will. Sanford, FL: Ligonier Ministries, October 2025.

"God has revealed an ordo salutis -- an order of salvation -- that gives us the logical sequence in which the benefits of Christ come to us. It begins with foreknowledge, which consists in God's setting His love on His people. Followed by unconditional election or predestination unto life, which is God's choice of those whom He loves for salvation. Then comes the outer call, or the preaching of the gospel, during which God at His appointed time gives His effectual call that draws the elect to Christ. The result of the effectual call is regeneration, or a new heart, that enters into conversion, the first part of which is saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ #Romans_8:29-30)" (30).

"There is no turning toward Christ in faith without a corresponding turn away from sin in repentance. If we think of conversion like a coin, one side is faith and the other side is repentance." (30).

## The Operations of the Holy Spirit in General

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"in passing from Christology to Soteriology, we pass from the objective to the subjective, from the work which God accomplished for us in Christ and which is in its sacrificial aspect a finished work, to the work which He realized as time goes on in the heart and lives of believers, and in which they are permitted, and slow expected, to cop-operate" (434).

"The Bible seems to teach on the one hand that the whole work of redemption is finished in Christ, so that nothing remains for man to do; and on the other hand, that the really decisive thing must still be accomplished in and through man" (434).

 "Scripture clearly shows that not all the operations of the Holy Spirit are part and parcel of the saving work of Jesus Christ. Just as the Son of God is not only the Mediator of redemption, but also the Mediator of creation, so the Holy Spirit, as represented in Scripture, is operative, not only in the work of redemption, but also in the work of creation" (435).

"The very first passage in which the Spirit is mentioned, Genesis 12, already calls attention to this life-giving function, and this is particularized in connection with the creation of man, #Genesis_2:7. The Spirit of God generates life and carries the creative work of God to completion #Job_33:4; #Job_34:14; #Psalm_104:29; #Isaiah_42:5)" (436).

 "By his general operations, He originates, maintains, strengthens, and guides all life, organic, intellectual, and moral. He does this in different ways and in harmony with the objects concerned" (437).

"As the covenant in which God made provision for the salvation of sinners is called the covenant of grace, and as the Mediator of the covenant is said to have appeared full of grace so that we can receive out of His fulness grace for grace #John_1:16 so the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of grace, since He takes the grace of Christ and confers it on us" (438).

See Kevin DeYoung's Daily Doctrine, pages 236-238.

1. The Holy Spirit convicts: #John_3:20, we get the sense of bringing sins to light, the Holy Spirit acts like a giant searchlight, exposing the world's wickedness, calling people to repentance, and convicting the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment.
2. The Holy Spirit converts: Jesus pours God's love into our hearts so we can be assured that in Christ God is for us and not against us #Romans_5:5). The Holy Spirit enables us to believe in the promises of God #John_1:12-13; #John_3:36; #John_6:63-65). They
3. The Holy Spirit applies: The Holy Spirit applies to the believer the benefits won by Christ, because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ.
4. The Holy Spirit glorifies
5. The Holy Spirit sanctifies: the Spirit gives us a new position in Christ--set apart and sprinkled with his blood and a new power #Ephesians_3:16.
6. The Holy Spirit equips: believers are given gifts for ministry.
7. The Holy Spirit promises: #Ephesians_1:13-14 states that in Christ we were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it.

- Ferguson, Sinclair. The Holy Spirit: Contours of Christian Theology. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1996.

"The ministry of the Spirit is not limited to gifts which serve the national establishment of God's people. His work is also moral and redemptive" (23).

#Isaiah_63:7-14 clarifies this with the reflections on the Exodus, the great paradigmatic redemptive act of the Old Testament. (1) The Spirit is associated with the activity of Moses in working miracles (Exodus 8:19). (2) The Spirit leads and guides the people into the benediction of covenant fulfilment, like cattle that go down to the plains, the Spirit of the Lord gave them rest. (3) The Spirit is the executive of the Exodus-redemption wrought by God the Savior. It is God who saves, and is against him that people thereafter rebel" (24).

 "For David, the presence of the Spirit and the possession of salvation and its joy are correlative" (25).

"The action of the Holy Spirit points to the sovereign newness of the work that God is accomplishing" (41).

"The human nature which the Son of God assumed was not created ex nihilo, but was inherited through Mary. It is our human nature, addicted to so many wretchednesses, as Calvin vividly puts it" (41).

## The Holy Spirit as the Dispenser of Divine Grace

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The word grace is not always used in the same sense in Scripture, but has a variety of meanings. The noun may denote gracefulness or beauty #Proverbs_22:11, but most generally means favor or goodwill. The Old Testament repeatedly speaks of finding favor in the eyes of God or in the eyes of man. The favor found carries with it the bestowal of favors or blessings. This means that the feasting itself is a beneficent act #Genesis_6:8; #Genesis_19:19; #Genesis_33:15; #Exodus_33:12; #Exodus_34:9; #1_Samuel_1:18; 27:5; #Ester_2:7)" (438).

Grace is an attribute of God, one of the divine perfections. It is God's free, sovereign, undeserved favor or love to man, in his state of sin and guilt, which manifests itself in the forgiveness of sin and deliverance from its penalty.

"Grace is applied not only to what Christ is, but also to what He merited for sinners. When the apostle speaks repeatedly in the closing salutations of his Epistles of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, he has in mind the grace of which Christ is the meritorious cause" (439).

"The teachings of Scripture respecting the grace of God stress the fact that God distributes His blessings to men in a free and sovereign manner, and not in consideration of any inherent merit of man; that men owe all blessings of life to a beneficent, forbearing, and longsuffering God; and especially that all the blessings of the work of salvation are freely given of God, and are in no way determined by supposed merits of men" (439).

- DeMarest, Bruce. *The Cross and Salvation: The Doctrine of Salvation*. Crossway, Wheaton, IL: 1997.

"Salvation is a work of the triune God. Scripture depecits teh Fahter as the ultiamte source, palnner, and initiator of savlation. In lovehe predestinaed us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with hsi pelasure and will--to praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves" (44).

"Christ, the Son, provided complete redemption through his obedience life and atoning death. The Holy Spirit applies, makes effective, and preserves the redemption Christ brought to thsoe who believe" (44)


- Ferguson, Sinclair. The Holy Spirit: Contours of Christian Theology. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1996.

"It is sometimes questioned whether Old Testament believers were regenerated. Nicodemus should not have been surprised #John_3:12-15. Already in the old covenant, the Lord circumcised the hearts of people #Deuteronomy_30:6; new life from God's hand was a reality in the old covenant, even if it only foreshadowed the fact of participating in the resurrection life of Christ (25-26).
