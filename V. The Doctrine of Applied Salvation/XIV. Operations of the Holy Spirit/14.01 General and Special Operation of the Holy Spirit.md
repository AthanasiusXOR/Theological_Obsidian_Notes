"Soteriology deals with the communication of the blessings of salvation to the sinner and his restoration to divine favor and to a life in intimate communion with God" (425).

"Who is not lifted in his soul and who does not raise his thought to the highest nature when he hears the names of the Spirit? For he is called the Spirit of God (Matthew 12:28), Spirit of truth, who comes fort from the Father (John 15:26), Spirit of righteousness (Psalm 50:12), and directing Spirit (Psalm 50:14). He is rightfully and properly called Holy Spirit, which is above all the names for everything incorporated, purely immaterial, and indivisible" (52-53).

"He lives, but not because he has been restored to life; rather, he is the source of life. He is the source of holiness. The Spirit is present to each one who is fit to receive him, as if he were present to him alone, and still he sends out grace that is complete and sufficient for all" (53).

"Now, those who have been sealed by the Holy Spirit for the day of redemption, and who preserve undiminished and inviolate the first fruit which they have received from the Spriit are the ones who will hear, well done, good and faithful servant, you were faithful in ta few things, I will establish you over many" (74-75).

"The biblical words for spirit are onomatopoeic terms, both their physical formation and their sound conveying a sense of their basic meanings: the expulsion of wind or breath, the idea of air in motion" (16).

"Those who are the subjects of the activity of the divine ruach act in supernatural ways, with supernatural energy and powers" (17).

"Yet the context of Genesis 1:2 suggests that the ruach elohim does not stand in an antithetical relationship to the creating agent. The further clear reference (Genesis 1:1, 3) to the activity of elohim as creative divine activity suggests that the most natural reading of elohim in verse 2 is in terms of divine activity. Isaiah 63:7-14 clearly identifies the Spirit as the executive of the Exodus" (19).

"The divine ruach is the mode of God's power-presence among his people" (21).

 "The Father sends, the Son comes, the Spirit (1 Timothy 3:16); the Father plans, the Son sacrifices and rises, the Spirit applies (1 Peter 1:1-2)" (21).

## Ordo Salutis

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The ordo salutis describes the process by which the work of salvation, wrought in Christ, is subjectively realized in the earths and lives of sinners" (426).

"The Bible does not give us a clear-cut ordo salutis; it does do two things which enable us to construe such an order. (1) It furnishes us with a very complete and rich enumeration of the operations of the Holy Spirit in applying the work of Christ to individual sinners, and of the blessings of salvation imparted to them. Words as regeneration, calling, conversion, and renewal repeatedly serve to designate the whole change that is brought about in the inner life of man. It teaches that we are justified by faith and not by works (Romans 3:30; 5:1; Galatians 2:11-20) that being justified, we have peace with God and access to Him (Romans 5:1, 2)  that we are set free from sin to become servants of righteousness, and to reap the fruit of sanctification (Romans 8:11-17; Galatians 4:4) that faith comes by the hearing of the word of God (Romans 10:17) that death unto the law results in life unto God (Galatians 2:19) that when we believe, we are sealed with the Spirit of God (Ephesians 4:1)  that having obtained the righteousness of God by faith, we share the sufferings of Christ, and also the power of His resurrection (Philippians 3:9) and that we are begotten again through the Word of God (427).

"The term [[15.03 Justification|justification]] is generally limited to what is called justification by faith, but is sometimes made to cover an objective justification of the elect in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the imputation of the righteousness of Christ to them in the pactum salutis. The word regeneration, which now generally designates that act of God by which He imparts the principle of the new life to man, is also used to designate the new birth or the first manifestation of the new life, and in the theology of the seventeenth century, it frequently occurs as synonymous with conversion or even [[15.04 Sanctification|sanctification]]. Some speak of it as passive conversion in the distinction from [[15.01 Conversion|conversion]] proper, which is then called active conversion" (429).

Typical Reformed Ordo Salutis (simplified):

1. Election – God’s eternal choice of specific individuals for salvation (Eph. 1:4–5).
2. Effectual Calling – The gospel call made effective by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:30).
3. Regeneration – The new birth or being made spiritually alive (John 3:3–8).
4. Conversion – Repentance and faith, enabled by regeneration (Acts 20:21).
5. Justification – God’s declaration of righteousness based on Christ’s merit (Rom. 5:1).
6. Adoption – Becoming children of God (Gal. 4:4–7).
7. Sanctification – The ongoing transformation into Christ’s likeness (1 Thess. 4:3).
8. Perseverance – God's preservation of the believer to the end (Phil. 1:6).

- DeYoung, Kevin. Daily Doctrine. Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2025.

"The order salutis helpfully reminds us that salvation is a unitary process with various aspects and movements (though we may not be conscious of each step). We can distinguish between what man does ([[15.02 Faith|faith]] and repentance) and what God alone does (regeneration and [[15.03 Justification|justification]]). We can distinguish between judicial acts, filial acts, and acts of moral renewal ([regeneration](onenote:15%20Conversion.one#15.05%20Regeneration&section-id={F8CD53B3-A05C-D245-8311-C76986D06AAC}&page-id={4FB9E8EE-95DB-4547-A426-562751A2BFC5}&end&base-path=https://d.docs.live.net/fc52dea27c35b98d/Documents/Reformed%20Dogmatics/V.%20The%20Doctrine%20of%20Applied%20Salvation) and [[15.04 Sanctification|sanctification]]). We can distinguish between elements of our salvation that are instantaneous (regeneration, definitive sanctification) and ongoing elements (progressive sanctification, preserve acne" (235-36).

"Romans 8:29-30, this text mentions elements of the ordo salutis, foreknowledge, predestination, calling, justification, and glorification. But faith is not mentioned here, nor is sanctification" (91).

- Parsons, Burk, editor. Table Talk Magazine: Bondage of the Will. Sanford, FL: Ligonier Ministries, October 2025.

"God has revealed an ordo salutis -- an order of salvation -- that gives us the logical sequence in which the benefits of Christ come to us. It begins with foreknowledge, which consists in God's setting His love on His people. Followed by unconditional election or predestination unto life, which is God's choice of those whom He loves for salvation. Then comes the outer call, or the preaching of the gospel, during which God at His appointed time gives His effectual call that draws the elect to Christ. The result of the effectual call is regeneration, or a new heart, that enters into conversion, the first part of which is saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 8:29-30)" (30).

"There is no turning toward Christ in faith without a corresponding turn away from sin in repentance. If we think of conversion like a coin, one side is faith and the other side is repentance." (30).

## The Operations of the Holy Spirit in General

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"in passing from Christology to Soteriology, we pass from the objective to the subjective, from the work which God accomplished for us in Christ and which is in its sacrificial aspect a finished work, to the work which He realized as time goes on in the heart and lives of believers, and in which they are permitted, and slow expected, to cop-operate" (434).

"The Bible seems to teach on the one hand that the whole work of redemption is finished in Christ, so that nothing remains for man to do; and on the other hand, that the really decisive thing must still be accomplished in and through man" (434).

 "Scripture clearly shows that not all the operations of the Holy Spirit are part and parcel of the saving work of Jesus Christ. Just as the Son of God is not only the Mediator of redemption, but also the Mediator of creation, so the Holy Spirit, as represented in Scripture, is operative, not only in the work of redemption, but also in the work of creation" (435).

"The very first passage in which the Spirit is mentioned, Genesis 12, already calls attention to this life-giving function, and this is particularized in connection with the creation of man, Genesis 2:7. The Spirit of God generates life and carries the creative work of God to completion (Job 33:4; 34:14; Psalms 104:29; Isaiah 42:5)" (436).

 "By his general operations, He originates, maintains, strengthens, and guides all life, organic, intellectual, and moral. He does this in different ways and in harmony with the objects concerned" (437).

"As the covenant in which God made provision for the salvation of sinners is called the covenant of grace, and as the Mediator of the covenant is said to have appeared full of grace so that we can receive out of His fulness grace for grace (John 1:16) so the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of grace, since He takes the grace of Christ and confers it on us" (438).

1. The Holy Spirit convicts: John 3:20, we get the sense of bringing sins to light, the Holy Spirit acts like a giant searchlight, exposing the world's wickedness, calling people to repentance, and convicting the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment.
2. The Holy Spirit converts: Jesus pours God's love into our hearts so we can be assured that in Christ God is for us and not against us (Romans 5:5). The Holy Spirit enables us to believe in the promises of God (Jon 1:12-13; 3:36; 6:63-65). They
3. The Holy Spirit applies: The Holy Spirit applies to the believer the benefits won by Christ, because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ.
4. The Holy Spirit glorifies
5. The Holy Spirit sanctifies: the Spirit gives us a new position in Christ--set apart and sprinkled with his blood and a new power (Ephesians 3:16).
6. The Holy Spirit equips: believers are given gifts for ministry.
7. The Holy Spirit promises: Ephesians 1:13-14 states that in Christ we were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it.

- Ferguson, Sinclair. The Holy Spirit: Contours of Christian Theology. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1996.

"The ministry of the Spirit is not limited to gifts which serve the national establishment of God's people. His work is also moral and redemptive" (23).

"Isaiah 63:7-14 clarifies this with the reflections on the Exodus, the great paradigmatic redemptive act of the Old Testament. (1) The Spirit is associated with the activity of Moses in working miracles (Exodus 8:19). (2) The Spirit leads and guides the people into the benediction of covenant fulfilment, like cattle that go down to the plains, the Spirit of the Lord gave them rest. (3) The Spirit is the executive of the Exodus-redemption wrought by God the Savior. It is God who saves, and is against him that people thereafter rebel" (24).

 "For David, the presence of the Spirit and the possession of salvation and its joy are correlative" (25).

"The action of the Holy Spirit points to the sovereign newness of the work that God is accomplishing" (41).

"The human nature which the Son of God assumed was not created ex nihilo, but was inherited through Mary. It is our human nature, addicted to so many wretchednesses, as Calvin vividly puts it" (41).

## The Holy Spirit as the Dispenser of Divine Grace

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The word grace is not always used in the same sense in Scripture, but has a variety of meanings. The noun may denote gracefulness or beauty (Proverbs 22:11), but most generally means favor or goodwill. The Old Testament repeatedly speaks of finding favor in the eyes of God or in the eyes of man. The favor found carries with it the bestowal of favors or blessings. This means that the feasting itself is a beneficent act (Genesis 6:8; 19:19; 33:15; Exodus 33:12; 34:9; 1 Samuel 1:18; 27:5; Ester 2:7)" (438).

Grace is an attribute of God, one of the divine perfections. It is God's free, sovereign, undeserved favor or love to man, in his state of sin and guilt, which manifests itself in the forgiveness of sin and deliverance from its penalty.

"Grace is applied not only to what Christ is, but also to what He merited for sinners. When the apostle speaks repeatedly in the closing salutations of his Epistles of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, he has in mind the grace of which Christ is the meritorious cause" (439).

"The teachings of Scripture respecting the grace of God stress the fact that God distributes His blessings to men in a free and sovereign manner, and not in consideration of any inherent merit of man; that men owe all blessings of life to a beneficent, forbearing, and longsuffering God; and especially that all the blessings of the work of salvation are freely given of God, and are in no way determined by supposed merits of men" (439).

- Ferguson, Sinclair. The Holy Spirit: Contours of Christian Theology. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1996.

"It is sometimes questioned whether Old Testament believers were regenerated. Nicodemus should not have been surprised (John 3:12-15). Already in the old covenant, the Lord circumcised the hearts of people (Deuteronomy 30:6); new life from God's hand was a reality in the old covenant, even if it only foreshadowed the fact of participating in the resurrection life of Christ (25-26).
