Special grace is a benefit of God as Redeemer that effectually imparts salvation, #Titus_2:11 (77).

Special grace originates with God the Father, #1_Corinthians_1:3; #Ephesians_1:3; #Titus_2:11, is mediated through the saving work of Jesus Christ, #Romans_5:15, #1_Corinthians_1:4; #Titus_3:6-7, and is made experientially real through the ministry of the Holy Spirit, #Zechariah_12:10; #Hebrews_10:29 (77).

Grace is also God's method for saving us (79).

Grace is a new stat or realm entered by faith (79).
