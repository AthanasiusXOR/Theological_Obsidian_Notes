 ## Presumptive and Promissory Regeneration


- DeMarest, Bruce. *The Cross and Salvation: The Doctrine of Salvation*. Crossway, Wheaton, IL: 1997

Covenant theologians, with other evangelicals, define regeneration as that radical change of nature from spiritual death to spiritual life wrought in us by Christ through the power of the Spirit. The new birth is the impartation by the triune God of a new heart. Regeneration is not a cooperative work between God and sinners (syngergism) rather, salvation is God's work from beginning to end (monergism)" (285).

Presumptive regeneration --> asserts that infants of believing parents are baptized not to become regenerated but because in some important sense they already possess the seeds of faith and regeneration. 

Promissory regeneration --> according to which baptism is judged a visible sign of God's covenant promise of new life to believing adults and their children (286). 

Begun in baptism, regeneration does not take place in one moment or one day or one year. Rather it is accomplished through continual and sometimes even slow advances (286). 

Old Testmaent circumcision and New Testament Baptism are related. Calvin insisted that infants are not capable of faith and repentance, but as members of the covenant family they are able to receive the seed of regeneration and [[15.05 Sanctification | sanctification]] (286).

The purpose of infant baptism is to testify that they are heirs of the blessing promised to the seed of the faithful and that after they are grown up, they may acknowledge the fact of their Baptism, and receive and produce its fruit. Calvin, baptism is like a sealed document to confirm to us that all our sins are so abolished, remitted, and effaced that they can never come to his sight, be recalled or charged agaisnt us (286).

God's word states that the unregenerate are morally evil, #Genesis_8:21, #Matthew_7:11, #Matthew_12:43, #John_3:19, and need to be made pure and clean (292).

Moreoever the unsaved are spiritually sick and need to be made spiritually healthy, #Matthew_9:12.
