"Scripture speaks of the perseverance of the saints as it does of sanctification--as both gift and task. The New Testament repeatedly admonishes believers to remain faithful, to stay true to their Savior and Lord #Matthew_24:13; #John_15:1-10; #Romans_2:7-8; #Colossians_1:23; #Hebrews_2:1; #Hebrews_3:14; #Hebrews_6:11; #1_John_2:6; #1_John_3:6, even unto death #Revelations_2:10; it threatens heavily punishment for unfaithfulness #Ezekiel_18:24; #Matthew_13:20-21; John 15:2; Romans 11:20; 2 Timothy 2:12; Hebrews 4:1; 6:4-8;10:26-31; 2 Peter 2:18-22)" ( 584).

"One of the most significant aspects of perseverance is the intercession of Christ. In the High Priestly Prayer, Jesus prayed that the Father would keep His elect from falling (John 17:11). We persevere only because God, in His grace and power, preserves us. In and of ourselves, each of us is capable of serious and radical falling, such as we saw in the life of David and in the life of Peter. Even as regenerate creatures, we are capable of full and final falling, I left to ourselves. But God does not lead His people by their own devices" (380-81).
