"Jesus Christ not only founded the Church, but also endowed it with the necessary power or authority. He is the Head of the Church, not only in an organic, but also in an administrative sense, that is, He is not only the Head of the body, but also the King of the spiritual commonwealth" (619).

"The Church of all ages is counted by their word #John_17:20; #1_John_1:3" (619).

"The officers in the Church receive their authority from Christ and not from men, even though the congregation is instrumental in putting them into office. This means on the one hand they do not obtain it at the hands of any civil authority, which has no power in ecclesiastical matters, and therefore cannot bestow any; but on the other hand, that they do not derive it from the people in general" ( 619).

## The Nature of this Power

Spiritual power: "When the power of the Church is called a spiritual power, this does not mean that it is altogether internal and invisible, since Christ rules both body and soul, His word and sacraments address the whole man, the minister of the diaconate even has special references to physical needs. IT is a spiritual power, because it is given by the Spirit of God #Acts_20:28 can only exercises int eh am of Christ and by the power of the Holy Sprite #John_20:22; #1_Corinthians_5:4), pertains exclusively believers #1_Corinthians 5:12) and can only e exercises morally and spiritually (2 Corinthians 10:4)" (620).

The ministerial power "it is abundantly evident form Scripture that the power of the Church is no independent and sovereign power (Matthew 20:25; 23:8; 2 Corinthians 10:4; 1 Peter 5:3) but a ministerial power (Acts 4:29; 20:24; Romans 1:1) derived from Christ and subordinate to His sovereign authority over the Church (Matthew 29:18). It must be exercised in harmony with the Word of God and under the direction of the Holy Spirit" (620-21).
