## The Institutes of Christian Baptism

"Christ instituted baptism after He had finished the work of reconciliation, and this had received the approval of the Father in the resurrection. It is worthy of notice that He prefaced the great commission with the words, "All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth. Clothed with the fullness of the mediatorial authority, He instituted Christian baptism and thus made it binding for all following generations" (651).

"Those who accepted Christ by faith were to be baptized in the name of the triune God, as a sign and seal of the fact that they had entered into a new relation to God, and as such were obliged to live according to the laws of the Kingdom of God" (651).

"The apostles were explicitly instructed to baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. The idea of on the authority of is expressed in Mark 21:9, 16:17; Luke 10:17; John 14:26; Acts 3:6; 9:27.

"Baptism has its foundation in the circumcision of the Old Testament. John the Baptist instituted water baptism even before Jesus started his public ministry. John's baptism is identifies to that of Jesus' disciples, it is a baptism for the forgiveness of sin (Acts 2:28). Jesus himself was baptized with John's baptism and made no distinction between the baptism administered by his disciples and that of John (John 3:22-23) but adopted the disciples baptized by John without baptizing them again (John 1:37; Acts 18:25)" (663).

"Baptism is the sign of all the blessings, all the benefits God promises us in the new covenant in Jesus Christ" (178).

"While faith is perfected by Baptism, Baptism is established by faith, and each is carried out by the same names" (Sir Basil, On the Holy Spirit, 2011: 59).

"Circumcision belonged to the former covenant: Baptism and the Lord's Supper pertain to the present covenant" (76).

## The Doctrine of Baptism in History

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The early Fathers regarded baptism as the rite of initiation into the Church, and usually considered it as closely connected with the forgiveness of sins and the communication of the new life" (653).

"Believed in baptismal regeneration" ( 653).

"Infant baptism was already current in the days of Origen and Tertullian, though the latter discouraged it on the ground of expediency. The general opinion was that baptism should never be repeated, but there was no unanimity as to the validity of baptism administered by heretics" (653).

The mode of baptism was not in dispute until the second century, when the mode of baptism slowly gained ground.

"Through this divine efficacy of the Word, the sacrament effects regeneration. In the case of adults, Maring Luther made the effect of baptism dependent on faith in the recipient. Realizing that he could not consider it so in the case of children, who cannot exercise faith, he at one time held that God by His prevenient grace works faith in the unconscious child, but later on professed ignorance on this point" (654).

## The Proper Mode of Baptism

Immersion - "a surrender of this would be equivalent to giving up baptism itself. The real baptismal idea, they say, is expressed in the going down into and the coming up out of, the water" (655).

Baptism would still be baptism even if one were immersed in something that lacks cleansing properties (Mark 10:38; Luke 12:50; Romans 6:3; Colossians 2:12).

See the Heidelberg Catechism Q69

Adult Baptism = "adult baptism must be preceded by a profession of faith (Mark 16:16; Acts 2:41; 8:37).

Differing Views = Adult Baptism (or believer baptism) (or credobaptism) versus infant baptism (or pedobaptism)

The only believers in Christ are entitled to baptism, and only those who give credible evidence of faith in Him should be baptized.

"It may be said at the outset that there is no explicit command in the Bible to baptize children, and that there is not a single instance in which we are plainly told that children were baptized. But this does not necessarily make infant baptism unbiblical:

1. The covenant made with Abraham was spiritual. The spiritual nature of this covenant is proved by the manner in which it promises are interpreted in the New Testament (Romans 4:16-18; 2 Corinthians 6:16-18; Galatians 3:8; Hebrews 8:10; 11:9). It follows from the fact the circumcision was clearly a rite that had spiritual significance (Deuteronomy 10:16; 30:6; Jeremiah 4:4; 9:25; Acts 15:1; Romans 2:26-29; Philippians 3:2).
2. The covenant is still in force and is essentially identical with the new covenant of the present dispensation.
