## Introductory Eschatology

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The name eschatology calls attention to the fact that the history of the world and of the human race will finally reach its consummation. It is not an indefinite and endless process, but a real history moving on to a divinely appointed end" (697).

There are general and individual eschatologies that must be taken into consideration. The events named may constitute the whole of eschatology in the strict sense of the word, yet we cannot do justice to this without showing how the generations who have died will participate in the final events. For the individual, the end of the present existence comes with death, which transfers him entirely from the present into the future age" (697).

In individual eschatology, we discuss physical death, immortality, and the [[19.02 The Intermediate State|intermediate state]].

## Physical Death

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"The scriptural idea of death includes physical, spiritual, and eternal death. Physical and spiritual death are naturally discussed in connection with the [[9.02 The Characteristics of Sin|Doctrine of Sin]], and eternal death is considered more particularly in general eschatology" (698).

### The Nature of Physical Death

#Matthew_10:28 and #Luke_12:4 speak of the death of the body, as distinguished from that of the soul. Here, the body is considered a living organism.

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"Separation of body and soul #Ecclesiastics_12:7; #Genesis_2:7; #James_2:26, as an idea that is also basic to such passages as #John_19:30; #Acts_7:59; #Philippians_1:23. In view of all this it may be said that, according to Scripture, physical death is a termination of physical life by the separation of body and soul" (698).

### The Connection of Sin and Death

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"Man was created in the image of God, and this, in view of the perfect condition in which the image of God existed originally, would seem to exclude the possibility of his carrying within him the seeds of dissolution and mortality. Physical death is not represented in Scripture as the natural result of the continuation of the original condition of man, due to his failure to rise to the height of immortality by the path of obedience, but as the result of his spiritual death #Romans_6:23; #Romans_5:21; #1_Corinthians_15:56" (699-700).

## The Immortality of the Soul

- Berkhof, Louis. Systematic Theology. Carlisle, PA: The Banner of Truth, 2021.

"In the absolute sense of the word, immortality is ascribed only to God. Paul speaks of in #1_Timothy_6:15. This does not mean that none of His creatures are immortal in any sense of the world. Immortality may be ascribed to some of His creatures, is contingent on the divine will, is conferred upon them, and therefore had a beginning" (702).

Immortality in the sense of continuous or endless existence is also ascribed to all spirits, including the human soul.
